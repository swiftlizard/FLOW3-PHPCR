# Jackalope [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jackalope/jackalope.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jackalope/jackalope)

A powerful implementation of the [PHPCR API](http://phpcr.github.com).

You can use Jackalope with different storage backends. For now, we support:

* *relational databases* with the DoctrineDBAL backend. Works with any
    database supported by doctrine (mysql, postgres, ...) and has no dependency
    on java or jackrabbit. For the moment, it is less feature complete.
    See [https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal](jackalope-doctrine-dbal)
* *Jackrabbit* server backend supports many features and requires you to simply
    install a .jar file for the data store component.
    See [https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-jackrabbit](jackalope-jackrabbit)
