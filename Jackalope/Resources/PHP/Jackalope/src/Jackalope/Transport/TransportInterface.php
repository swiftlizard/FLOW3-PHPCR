     * Get the node from an absolute path

     * each property and one field for each child.
     * A child is just containing an empty class as value (in the future we
     * could use this for eager loading with recursive structure).
     * A property consists of a field named as the property is and a value that
     * is the property value, plus a second field with the same name but
     * prefixed with a colon that has a type specified as value (out of the
     * string constants from PropertyType)
     *
     * For binary properties, the value of the type declaration is not the type
     * but the length of the binary, thus integer instead of string.
     * There is no value field for binary data (to avoid loading large amount
     * of unneeded data)
     * Use getBinaryStream to get the actual data of a binary property.
     *
     * There is a couple of "magic" properties:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>jcr:uuid - the unique id of the node</li>
     *   <li>jcr:primaryType - name of the primary type</li>
     *   <li>jcr:mixinTypes - comma separated list of mixin types</li>
     *   <li>jcr:index - the index of same name siblings</li>
     * </ul>

     * <code>
     * object(stdClass)#244 (4) {
     *      ["jcr:uuid"]=>
     *          string(36) "64605997-e298-4334-a03e-673fc1de0911"

     *      ["myProperty"]=>
     *          string(4) "test"
     *      [":myProperty"]=>
     *          string(5) "String" //one of \PHPCR\PropertyTypeInterface::TYPENAME_NAME
     *      [":myBinary"]=>
     *          int 1538    //length of binary file, no "myBinary" field present
