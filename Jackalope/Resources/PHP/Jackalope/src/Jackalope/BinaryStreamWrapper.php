/**
 * This class implements a stream wrapper that allows for lazy loaded binary
 * properties.
 *
 * The stream is registered for the protocol "jackalope://". The URL must
 * contain the sessions registryKey as the host part and the oath of the binary
 * property as the path part, e.g. "jackalope://abc0123/content/node/binary"
 *
 * For multivalued properties the url also contains the position of the stream
 * in the property array in the port field and a token to identify all streams
 * loaded by the single backend call in an static array as username.
 *
 * The loading from the backend is deferred until the stream is accessed. Then
 * it is loaded and all stream functions are passed on to the underlying
 * stream. This means after closing the Session, streams can no longer be
 * accessed.
