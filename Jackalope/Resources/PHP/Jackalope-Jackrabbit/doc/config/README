=============
Documentation
=============

The documentation of this project follows the semantics and paradigms of
phpdoctor[1] and PHPDocumentor[1].

If you want to /use/ the PHPCR API, you should look at the documentation of
PHPCR, and not at the Jackalope implementation doc, as you should not rely on
implementation specifics.
The PHPCR documentation is online at http://phpcr.github.com/doc/html/index.html

Since the documentation is updated constantly and easy to generate, it is not
included in the project. Please see the phpcr README file in phpcr doc/config/
for how to generate the current doc.
